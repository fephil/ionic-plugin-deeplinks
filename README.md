Ionic Deeplinks Plugin
======

This is a fork of the no longer maintained [Ionic Deeplinks](https://github.com/fephil/ionic-plugin-deeplinks) plugin with a few changes:

* Supports 3 deeplinks with paths.
* Reverts the "fix(routing): fixes routing for custom app scheme" change as it breaks everything.

This repository is *NOT* supported in any way. It's a bespoke version of the plugin for my personal needs. Do not use this.
